## Periodic table of HTML 5 elements

There have been a few different versions of this and it is not my original idea. This version is made with css only, so modern browsers please.

## Build

- Install Node.js
- Run `npm install` command on the root directory
- Run `npm start` command which is defined in `package.json` scripts section
